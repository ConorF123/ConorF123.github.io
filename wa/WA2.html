    <h3>The Basics:</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Conor Fagan (He/Him). I'm a 22 year old exchange student from Dublin, Ireland and I'm here in Boulder as a CTD major for the semester.</p>
    <p>Some of the things I enjoy are hiking, cooking, gaming, and playing the guitar <em>(badly)</em>. I also have a cat named Stubbs.</p>

    <h3>My Goals for this Course:</h3>
    <p>I took this class because I knew very little about web design and I would like to become competent in this field.</p>
